# Proposal

Our app is useful to get the best price for your AirBnB rental depending on the area you're in and the accomodations you're offering. Our brilliant Data Science team dug through over seventeen thousand records to bring accurate results to any inquiry, in Germany. Our mission statement, should we have chosen to accept it, is to help users get the best value from their AirBnB accounts.

# Features

MVP would clearly be to give a user the best asking price for a given property they intend to list on AirBnB. In future we'd like to expand our service outside of Germany and also tie tighter to the actual listings entered without as much user input.

- What do the top 3 similar apps do for their users?

There are similar apps? Certainly not ones as accurate. Our Data Scientists are the bees knees.

# Frameworks - Libraries

- What 3rd party frameworks/libraries are you considering using?

We used Formik for forms, well, I did. Semantic UI for styles, FontAwesome for icons, React is the main library of course, but hooks are key as well.

- Do APIs require you to contact its maintainer to gain access?

Sometimes they do. I mean, not for us, we're cool. Just in general, maintainers are very lonely people.

- Are you required to pay to use the API?

Nah, I told them you'd pay. LOL.

- Have you considered using Apple Frameworks? (MapKit, Healthkit, ARKit?)

I've considered taking pottery classes, but here we are.

# Target Audience

- Who is your target audience? Be specific.

People with AirBnBable properties named Brian.

- What feedback have you gotten from potential users?

How were we supposed to reach these 'potential users'? We haven't marketed it, we've been busy building it and all.

- Have you validated the problem and your solution with your target audience? How?

Yes, the focus groups we set up in Galviston, Winnipeg and Albuquerque were instrumental in our ultimate solution for this problem. They all say "you're awesome".

# Grading Rubric Checklist for J.Sonnichsen:
- MVP work - Project should incorporate all of the listed MVP features
I built my agreed features, then helped the team finish off theirs to finish a presentable product.
 
- Team Work Score 
Pair programmed with nearly every member of the team, usually multiple times. Attended all called meetings by PM or React Devs. Helped with git consolidation early on. Still available to help nearly any late night on #lambdabynight.

- Sprint 1-Applied JavaScript
I used events in JSX to push react functionality, but spent a lot of time covering necessary functions rather than incorporate animations.

- Sprint 2-Intro to React
Used useState and useEffect like whoah, learned useContext, but didn't get to implement it in favor of finishing a presentable app and not taking MVP from a unit 3 react dev.

- Sprint 3- SPA
Used axios and route to great effect. Usage of finer points of route confused a number of people. Not sure I did it right, but it works and that counts. Nested doesn't begin to cover it. I've got container vs presentational components by the score.
