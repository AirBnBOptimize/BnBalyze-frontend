# Proposal

Our app is useful to get the best price for your AirBnB rental depending on the area you're in and the accomodations you're offering. Our brilliant Data Science team dug through over seventeen thousand records to bring accurate results to any inquiry. Our mission statement is to help users get the best value from their AirBnB accounts.

# Features

MVP would be to give a user the best asking price for a given property they intend to list on AirBnB. In future we'd like to expand our service outside of Germany and also tie tighter to the actual listings entered without as much user input.

# Frameworks - Libraries

- What 3rd party frameworks/libraries are you considering using?

We used Formik for forms. Semantic UI for styles. FontAwesome for icons. React is the main library of course, but hooks are key as well.

- Do APIs require you to contact its maintainer to gain access?
- Are you required to pay to use the API?

No, the information is freely available.

# Target Audience

- Who is your target audience? Be specific.

People with AirBnBable properties.

# Grading Rubric Checklist for J.Sonnichsen:
- MVP work - Project should incorporate all of the listed MVP features
I built my agreed upon features, then helped the team finish off theirs to finish a presentable product.
 
- Team Work Score 
Pair programmed with nearly every member of the team, usually multiple times. Attended all called meetings by PM or React Devs. Helped with git instruction and merges to resolve conflicts. Still available to help nearly any late night on #lambdabynight.

- Sprint 1-Applied JavaScript
I used events in JSX to push react functionality, but spent most of my time covering necessary functions to make a complete app rather than incorporate animations.

- Sprint 2-Intro to React
Used useState and useEffect, learned useContext, but didn't get to implement it in favor of finishing the app.

- Sprint 3- SPA
Used axios and route to great effect. Not sure I did it right, but it works and that counts. Used nested routes and passed values through them with the render prop.
